      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        I recently completed a Bachelor of Information and Communication Technology with a major in Cyber Security at the University of Tasmania. During my studies, I developed a strong interest in practical IT support, systems administration and how secure systems are designed and operated in the real world. [file:73]
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside my degree, I worked in duty management and supervisory roles at Woolworths, Chemist Warehouse and Hill Street Grocer. These roles gave me experience leading teams, solving problems under pressure and working with in‑store systems and devices to keep operations running smoothly. [file:73]
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m now looking for an entry-level role in IT support, systems administration or a related IT position where I can apply my technical knowledge, keep learning and contribute to reliable, secure IT environments. [file:73]
