      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        I am an ICT graduate with a Cyber Security major who enjoys understanding how systems fit together and helping people when technology gets in the way of their work. I am currently based in Tasmania and am open to early-career IT opportunities locally, including support, operations and security-focused roles.

      <h2>My Journey into IT</h2>
      <p>
        I have always been curious about how technology works behind the scenes—how so much capability can be packed into a phone, laptop or small device. That curiosity led me to study a Bachelor of Information and Communication Technology with a Cyber Security major at the University of Tasmania, where I was able to connect that interest to real systems, networks and security concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my degree I particularly enjoyed units that combined hands-on work with problem solving, such as security and network subjects and my industry project with HealthCare Software. Working on a real healthcare application showed me how design, development, security and operations all need to come together so that people can rely on technology in their day-to-day jobs.

      <h2>Work and Study</h2>
      <p>
        While studying, I worked in supermarkets and pharmacies in roles that involved supervising teams, serving customers and keeping daily operations on track. Balancing shift work with assignments and group projects taught me how to manage my time, stay organised and remain calm when there are competing priorities.
      </p>
      <p>
        These roles also gave me constant exposure to in-store systems such as POS, stock and scheduling tools. I became comfortable using technology in a live environment, troubleshooting simple issues and explaining what was happening to customers and colleagues in clear, practical language.
      </p>

      <h2>How I Work</h2>
      <p>
        I like to approach technical problems by first understanding what the user is experiencing, checking simple things that might be wrong and then methodically working through possible causes. If I reach a point where I am unsure, I am comfortable asking for guidance, documenting what I have already tried and learning from the solution so I can handle similar issues more independently next time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy roles where I can help people, keep systems running smoothly and steadily build my technical skills over time. In a team, I aim to be reliable, respectful and clear in my communication, and I take ownership of seeing tasks through to completion, even when they are routine.
      </p>

      <h2>What I’m Focusing on Now</h2>
      <p>
        Right now I am strengthening my foundations in areas that are important for entry-level IT roles, including Windows and Linux administration, basic networking concepts and cloud fundamentals with a focus on Microsoft Azure. I am also interested in developing my scripting and automation skills over time so that I can contribute more to improving processes and reducing manual work.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal over the next year is to move into an IT role where I can support users, look after systems and keep learning from more experienced colleagues, while building towards more responsibility in operations or security.
