      <h1>Experience</h1>
      <p>
        My experience comes from working in busy retail environments while studying ICT, leading and supporting teams on shift, and collaborating on university group projects with real industry clients. These roles have taught me to stay calm under pressure, communicate clearly with different people and work confidently with the systems and processes that keep operations running.

      <h2>Duty Manager – Woolworths Supermarkets</h2>
      <p class="meta">Hobart, TAS · March 2023 – Present</p>
      <p>
        At Woolworths I work as a Duty Manager, responsible for the store team, daily operations and making sure shifts run smoothly. I regularly use POS systems, stock handling tools and staff scheduling systems, and keep basic incident notes so issues are recorded and followed up.
      </p>
      <p>
        One shift that stands out was around the time of the major CrowdStrike–Microsoft incident in 2024, when a faulty security update caused Windows systems to crash and disrupted many businesses worldwide. In our store this showed up as registers freezing, logins taking longer than usual and some devices needing to be restarted before they could be used. I coordinated with the store manager to move extra staff to the front end, kept customers updated while queues were forming and followed our local restart and fallback procedures until systems stabilised again. [web:139][web:148][web:152]
      </p>
      <p>
        Experiencing a global IT outage from the shop floor gave me a practical view of how technical issues at the endpoint level can quickly become business and customer problems. It also reinforced the importance of clear communication, staying calm and having simple workarounds ready—skills that transfer directly into IT support and service desk roles.

      <h2>Supervisor – Hill Street Grocer</h2>
      <p class="meta">Hobart, TAS · October 2023 – March 2024</p>
      <p>
        At Hill Street Grocer I worked as a Supervisor, helping to coordinate the front-of-store team and daily operations. I used POS terminals, stock and pricing systems and basic reporting tools to keep track of sales, stock levels and end-of-day cash balances. [file:73]
      </p>
      <p>
        On busy shifts I allocated staff to checkouts, fresh departments and floor tasks, answered customer enquiries and stepped in when issues came up at the registers. If there were gaps in staffing or last-minute changes, I adjusted the plan, communicated with the team and made sure essential tasks were still covered before close. [file:73]
      </p>
      <p>
        This role helped me build confidence leading small teams, prioritising tasks in real time and explaining decisions clearly to different people. Those same skills are important in IT roles where you often need to balance multiple tickets, keep users informed and make sure the most critical work is completed first. [web:126][web:129]

      <h2>Team Member – Chemist Warehouse</h2>
      <p class="meta">Hobart, TAS · March 2024 – June 2025</p>
      <p>
        At Chemist Warehouse I worked as a Team Member in a busy retail pharmacy, serving customers at the front counter and helping keep the store organised. I regularly used the POS and inventory systems to process transactions, check stock and assist with product enquiries. [file:73]
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the store handled health-related products and prescriptions, attention to detail and following procedures were very important. I made sure labels, prices and promotional items were correct, checked product locations carefully before advising customers and followed store policies when escalating questions to pharmacists and senior staff. [file:73]
      </p>
      <p>
        The role strengthened my focus on accuracy, clear communication and respecting privacy and process—qualities that are also important when working with user data, tickets and documentation in IT environments. [web:120][web:123]

      <h2>Teamwork and Projects</h2>
      <p>
        During my Bachelor of Information and Communication Technology (Cyber Security major) at the University of Tasmania, I worked in several group projects, including an industry project with HealthCare Software. Our team built a secure photo uploader for healthcare professionals, and I focused on security and testing, helping to design test plans, document issues and work with the team to validate the system against client requirements. [file:32][file:33][file:73]
      </p>
      <p>
        These projects taught me how to collaborate in Agile-style iterations, communicate with non-technical stakeholders and balance usability with security and reliability. They also showed me how important it is to document decisions and test results clearly so that the whole team understands the current state of a system. [file:32][file:33]

      <h2>Growing Up, Moving and Balancing Work with Study</h2>
      <p>
        I grew up in India and moved to Australia to study ICT, which meant adapting to a new country while managing university and part-time work at the same time. Balancing shifts in retail with assignments and project deadlines taught me how to plan ahead, use my time well and stay committed even when things were busy. [file:73]
      </p>
      <p>
        This experience has made me comfortable handling responsibility and change, and it is a big part of why I am interested in IT support and systems roles where reliability, learning quickly and supporting others are essential. [file:73][web:120]

      <h2>How I Work</h2>
      <p>
        Across my roles and studies I have built a calm, practical approach to problems. When something goes wrong, I first try to understand what is happening, look for simple checks or known fixes and then escalate or ask for help when needed. I keep customers and teammates updated so they know what to expect. [web:119][web:135]
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy helping people, documenting steps so others can follow them, and improving small processes that make work smoother. In my first IT role, I want to be the teammate who can be trusted to follow through on tasks, communicate clearly and keep learning as systems and tools evolve. [web:120][web:123]
