      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <p>
        These projects come from my university studies and personal learning. They show how I work with real requirements, collaborate in a team and build practical solutions using web, mobile and cloud technologies.

      <h2>Secure Photo Uploader for Healthcare Professionals</h2>
      <p class="meta">Industry Project · University of Tasmania · Client: HealthCare Software</p>
      <p>
        As part of my final-year industry project, I worked with a small team to design and build a secure photo uploader for healthcare professionals. The goal was to give clinicians a safer way to capture and upload patient images from their mobile devices into a controlled cloud environment, instead of keeping sensitive photos on personal phones.
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution combined a mobile application with a cloud backend using Microsoft Azure services for storage, identity and data management. My focus in the team was on security and testing: understanding the key risks, planning how to verify that the system behaved correctly and helping the team check that new features did not introduce unexpected issues.
      </p>
      <h3>My Role</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Worked with the team to understand the client’s requirements around privacy, consent and secure handling of patient images.</li>
        <li>Designed and executed test cases for sign-in, authorisation, photo capture and upload flows, including edge cases and failure scenarios.</li>
        <li>Helped validate that images and related data were correctly stored and retrieved in the Azure environment according to the intended design.</li>
        <li>Documented defects, retested fixes and contributed to progress updates and demonstrations for the client and supervisors.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What I Learned</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>How to think about security, privacy and usability together when building systems for real users in a sensitive domain.</li>
        <li>Working in an Agile-style project with an external client, where communication and clear documentation are as important as the code itself.</li>
        <li>Practical experience collaborating with others on a shared codebase and test plan, and adapting as requirements evolved.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Due to confidentiality, I do not share screenshots or technical implementation details from this project in my portfolio, but I am happy to discuss my role and approach in more detail during an interview.

      <h2>Virtual Travel Journal</h2>
      <p class="meta">Personal / Coursework Project · Full-Stack Web Application</p>
      <p>
        The Virtual Travel Journal is a web application that allows users to register, log in and record their travel experiences as journal entries, with an archive view for browsing previous trips. I originally built it as a small full-stack project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL, handling both the front end and the server-side logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        The current version of the site in my portfolio showcases the front-end implementation, including the layout, navigation and forms for creating and viewing entries. The original backend that handled authentication and data storage is no longer deployed, but the structure of the pages reflects how the system worked end-to-end.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>User registration and login forms designed to support account creation and authentication.</li>
        <li>A create-entry page where users could add trip details, descriptions and images to their journal.</li>
        <li>An archive page layout for browsing previous entries in a visually organised way.</li>
        <li>Responsive styling to keep the site readable on different screen sizes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Example Screens</h3>
      <p>Below are examples of how the Virtual Travel Journal looks.</p>

        <figcaption>Archive-style layout for browsing travel entries, showing how content and imagery are presented together.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <!-- Optional: add more screenshots here later -->

      <h3>What I Learned</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Designing and building a small web application from scratch, from page structure and styling through to form handling and (originally) database integration.</li>
        <li>Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript together with PHP and SQL concepts to support user accounts and content storage.</li>
        <li>Debugging layout and logic issues across multiple pages, and thinking about how users move through a site when completing tasks.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Other Work</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to these projects, my degree included labs and assignments in areas such as networking, security, scripting and database design. These gave me experience configuring systems in controlled environments, writing small scripts to automate tasks and working with SQL to design and query relational data.
