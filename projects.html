      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <p>
        These projects come from my university studies and personal learning. They show how I work with real requirements, collaborate in a team and build practical solutions using web, mobile and cloud technologies.

      <h2>Secure Photo Uploader for Healthcare Professionals</h2>
      <p class="meta">Industry Project · University of Tasmania · Client: HealthCare Software</p>
      <p>
        As part of my final-year industry project, I worked with a small team to design and build a secure photo uploader for healthcare professionals. The goal was to give clinicians a safer way to capture and upload patient images from their mobile devices into a controlled cloud environment, instead of keeping sensitive photos on personal phones.
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution combined a mobile application with a cloud backend using Microsoft Azure services for storage, identity and data management. My focus in the team was on security and testing: understanding the key risks, planning how to verify that the system behaved correctly and helping the team check that new features did not introduce unexpected issues.
      </p>
      <h3>My Role</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Worked with the team to understand the client’s requirements around privacy, consent and secure handling of patient images.</li>
        <li>Designed and executed test cases for sign-in, authorisation, photo capture and upload flows, including edge cases and failure scenarios.</li>
        <li>Helped validate that images and related data were correctly stored and retrieved in the Azure environment according to the intended design.</li>
        <li>Documented defects, retested fixes and contributed to progress updates and demonstrations for the client and supervisors.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What I Learned</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>How to think about security, privacy and usability together when building systems for real users in a sensitive domain.</li>
        <li>Working in an Agile-style project with an external client, where communication and clear documentation are as important as the code itself.</li>
        <li>Practical experience collaborating with others on a shared codebase and test plan, and adapting as requirements evolved.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Due to confidentiality, I do not share screenshots or technical implementation details from this project in my portfolio, but I am happy to discuss my role and approach in more detail during an interview.

  <h2>Virtual Travel Journal</h2>
  <p class="meta">Personal / Coursework Project · Full-Stack Web Application</p>
  <p>
    The Virtual Travel Journal is a web application that allows users to register, log in and record their travel experiences as journal entries, with an archive view for browsing previous trips. I originally built it as a small full-stack project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL, handling both the front end and the server-side logic.
  </p>
  <p>
    The original backend was developed for a university hosting environment and used PHP and a MySQL database to manage user accounts and journal entries. After the unit ended that environment was shut down, so the live backend is no longer available. For this portfolio I host the front-end pages as a static demo, which still shows the structure, navigation and forms that the application used.
  </p>

  <h3>How the Backend Worked</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>PHP scripts handled user registration and login, checking credentials against a MySQL users table and maintaining sessions for logged-in users.</li>
    <li>Journal entries were stored in a database table with fields such as title, tags, content and timestamps, linked to the user who created them.</li>
    <li>Create and archive pages interacted with the database to insert new entries and retrieve existing ones for display in the interface.</li>
    <li>Basic validation and query structure were used to reduce common issues such as empty fields and simple injection attempts.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Key Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>User registration and login forms designed to support account creation and authentication.</li>
    <li>A create-entry page where users could add trip details, descriptions and images to their journal.</li>
    <li>An archive page layout for browsing previous entries in a visually organised way.</li>
    <li>Consistent navigation and styling across pages so users always know where they are in the app.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Example Screens</h3>
  <p>Below are examples of how the Virtual Travel Journal looks.</p>

  <h3>What I Learned</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Designing and building a small web application from scratch, from page structure and styling through to form handling and database integration.</li>
    <li>Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript together with PHP and SQL concepts to support user accounts and content storage.</li>
    <li>Debugging layout and logic issues across multiple pages, and thinking about how users move through a site when completing tasks.</li>
  </ul>
