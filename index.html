      <h2>Featured Project</h2>
      <h3>Secure Photo Uploader for Healthcare Professionals</h3>
      <p>
        Industry project with HealthCare Software where our team built a secure photo uploader for clinicians to
        capture and upload patient images into a controlled cloud environment, reducing the risk of sensitive data
        remaining on personal devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        I focused on security and testing, helping to design test cases, validate authentication and upload flows
        and document issues for the client.
