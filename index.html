      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I recently completed a Bachelor of Information and Communication Technology with a major in Cyber Security at the University of Tasmania. During my studies, I developed a strong interest in practical IT support, systems administration and how secure systems are designed and operated in the real world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside my degree, I worked in duty management and supervisory roles at Woolworths, Chemist Warehouse and Hill Street Grocer. These roles gave me experience leading teams, solving problems under pressure and working with in‑store systems and devices to keep operations running smoothly.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m now looking for an entry-level role in IT support, systems administration or a related IT position where I can apply my technical knowledge, keep learning and contribute to reliable, secure IT environments.

        <h3>Secure Photo Uploader for Healthcare Professionals – Mobile &amp; Cloud Application</h3>
        <div class="meta">
          University of Tasmania · Group project for HealthCare Software (industry client)
        </div>
        <p>
          Worked as Security &amp; Testing Lead on a React Native and .NET (C#) mobile application that enables clinicians to securely capture and upload patient photos from their devices to Azure cloud storage. I helped design and execute test plans for authentication, authorisation, upload workflows, metadata handling and audit trails, identifying and documenting defects and edge cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          I contributed to validating the integration between the mobile app, Azure Blob Storage and Azure SQL to ensure data integrity and secure handling of sensitive healthcare information, and assisted with Agile cycle reports and user documentation for the client.

        <h3>Virtual Travel Journal – Full‑Stack Web Application</h3>
        <div class="meta">
          University of Tasmania
        </div>
        <p>
          Built a full‑stack virtual travel journal web application with HTML, CSS and JavaScript on the frontend and PHP with MySQL (MariaDB) on the backend. The system supports user registration and login, creating and editing posts, and viewing an archive of previous entries.
        </p>
        <p>
          I implemented user authentication, post handling and an archive view using a relational database, and applied basic security practices such as input validation, role‑based access control and protection against SQL injection, along with responsive design to support different devices.
